This library is derived from the NUI project.  
It aims to be an alternative system to the typical management layout with menus and details.  
In Jack a CARD represents an entity.  
This CARD can be connected to another entity, moved to make order or displayed simultaneously with 
other entities to make comparisons or copy data.  
These characteristics are specific to the UX and are independent of the entity itself.
